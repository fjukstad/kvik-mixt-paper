        \parttitle{Background} 
            In scientific fields such as systems biology there is a need for
            interactive data exploration tools that enable new insights in the
            fast growing datasets. 
            These tools consist of components such as advanced
            statistical analyses and known biology from up-to-date databases.
            While the problem each tool is aiming to solve, their underlying
            components stay the same.  This enables application developers to
            compose applications of reusable services rather than implementing a
            single monolithic application.
            
        \parttitle{Results} 
            We have designed an approach for developing data exploration
            applications in systems biology that builds on the microservice
            architecture which structures an application as a collection of
            services rather than a large monolithic entity. 
            We have demonstrated its viability
            through a web application for exploring and comparing
            transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples. 
            Using this approach we are able to build language-agnostic data
            exploration applications that interface with advanced statistical
            software and up-to-date information from biological databases.  

        \parttitle{Conclusions}  
            Our approach and reference implementation Kvik, enables easy
            development of data exploration tools that interface with
            statistical analyzes and online databases. 
            Kvik is open-sourced at \url{github.com/fjukstad/kvik} and the web
            application for exploring transcriptional profiles, MIxT, is 
            availible at \url{github.com/fjukstad/mixt}.
