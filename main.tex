\section*{Background}
In the past decade the generation of biological datasets has been unprecedented,
and the famous "\$1000k genome, \$1M analysis"\cite{} has become more apparent.
To decrease both time and cost of analysing biological data, there is now a
growing number of analysis framework in various programming languages.\cite{}

In R, there are popular package repositories such as CRAN
\url{cran.r-project.org} or Bioconductor \url{bioconductor.org} where developers
can share software packages and keep them up-to-date. In these repositories
researchers can find software for exploring high-throughput genomic data in one
environment. This includes both pre-processing, e.g. cleaning, removing
liers, and analysing it with known statistical methods. 

Through initiatives such as ApacheR and OpenCPU there has been a move towards
embedding scientific computation in data visualization application. This removes
the decoupling of statistical frameworks and interaction with the analysis
results. 

Interpreting the analysis results require integration of known biology, either
from biological databases such as MSigDB\cite{} or KEGG\cite{}, or through
scientific publications from reference databases such as PubMed\cite{}.
Performing manual lookup into these databases is often tedious and error-prone,
making it necessary to automate the task. 
% Hvorfor bryr vi oss om både stats + DBs? 

In systems biology there have been a growth of tools for visualizing biological
datasets from high-throughput experiments.

In systems biology there is a need for visualization tools that can make use of
the lastest statistical packages and interact with these. It is not enough to
visualize the results of an analysis pipeline, but interact with the different
steps from the final visualization. Examples of this interaction can be
modifying clustering parameters that are used in the analysis.

While there are visualization frameworks for researchers with a background in
programming, there is a need to build data exploration applications for
non-coders with graphical user interfaces.

Especially large datasets in biology require sophisticated methods for
visualizing and interpreting the results, as well as communicating and sharing
the findings.   

We have 
\subsubsection*{Requirements} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A language-independent approach for integrating, or embedding,
        statistical software, such as R, directly in interactive data
        exploration applications.

        understanding results from statistical analyses. 
    \item Ease of software development, maintenance and deployment. 
\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate} 


\subsection*{Related Work} 
In this section we aim to cover the existing approaches for building interactive
data exploration applications in systems biology. 

% TODO: Add related work where somebody has built a system for exploring some
% data where 

\subsubsection*{OpenCPU} 
OpenCPU is a system for embedded scientific computing and reproducible
research.\cite{opencpu} It provides an HTTP API to the R programming language to
provide an interface with statistical methods. It enables users to make function
calls to any R package and retrieve the results in a wide variety of formats
such as json or pdf. 
Users can chose to host their own R server or use public servers, and OpenCPU
works in a single-user setting within an R session, or a multi-user setting
facilitating multiple parallel requests. 
OpenCPU provides a Javascript library for interfacing with R, as well as Docker
containers for easy installation. OpenCPU has been used to build multiple
applications.\footnote{\url{opencpu.org/apps.html}} In Kvik we provide a package
to interface with OpenCPU servers from the Go programming language since it
follows the design pattern we have chosen to interface with data and analyses. 


\subsubsection*{Renjin} 
Renjin is a JVM-based interpreter for the R programming language.\cite{renjin}
It targets developers who want to integrate the R interpreter in web
applications. Since it is built on top of the JVM it allows developers to write
data exploration applications that interact directly with R code. Although
Renjin supports a large number of CRAN packages it cannot access any R package
(e.g. from BioConductor) without modification. This makes the programming effort
to use Renjin as an interface with R higher since it means re-implementing R
packages to use. 

\subsubsection*{Shiny} 
Shiny is a web application framework for R.\cite{shiny} It allows developers to
build web applications in R without having to have any knowledge about HTML, CSS
or Javascript. It provides a widget library to provide more advanced Javascript
visualizations such as Leaflet for maps or threejs for WebGL-accellerated
graphics. Developers can choose to host their own web server with the user-built
Shiny Apps, or host them on public servers. Shiny forces users to implement data
exploration applications in R, limiting the functionality to the available
widgets and libraries in Shiny. 

\subsubsection*{Biogo} 
Biogo is a bioinformatics library in Go. It provides functionality to analyse
genomic and metagenomc datasets in the go programming
language.\cite{Kortschak005033} Using the go programming language the developers
are able to provide high-performance parallel processing in a clean and simple
programming language. 

\subsubsection*{Cytoscape} 
Cytoscape is an open source software platform for visualizing complex
networks and integrating these with any type of attribute
data\cite{shannon2003cytoscape}. It allows for analysis and visualization in the
same platform. Users can add additional features, such as databases connections
or new layouts, through Apps. To bring the visualization and analysis
capabilities to the web the creators of Cytoscape have developed
Cytoscape.js\footnote{\url{js.cytoscapejs.org}}, a Javascript library to create
interactive graph visualizations. 


\section*{Methods} 
\subsection*{Data analysis} 
In this section we describe our typical approach for doing analysing gene
expression data in systems biology, and how it shaped the intergration of
statistics in developing our data exploration applications. Our group is
of a mix of statisticians, epidemiologists, and biologists, making one of our
aims to develop tools that work well together with the tools already in use. 

We typically start off with a messy dataset that needs to go through
several stages of clean-up and preprocessing before we can analyze it. After the
preprocessing we typically develop some simple visualizations that help discover 
simple patterns in the data. After this quick dirty data exploration we start to
apply more advanced statistical methods to look for more intricate patterns in
the data. After this analysis we often end up with genes or lists of genes of
interest that we can use to guide database lookup. 

In terms of data analysis code, the preprocessing steps typically consist of
one or more R scripts that we knit \cite{knitr} into PDF reports that we can
revisit later. From these scripts we end up with analysis-ready datasets that
can be shared within the group. The remaining downstream analysis often starts
out in scripts, that are built into R packages with analysis code that can be
shared between researchers. 

With this process in mind, we designed the interface to the R programming
language in Kvik. We want to make it possible to call any function from an R
package and return its results either as plain text, such as comma-separated
tables, or binaries such as images. Enforcing that R code is built into R
packages ensures that the analysis code can be used by power users through an
ordinary R session or in the data exploration application itself. 


\subsection*{Databases} 
Similar to how our analysis process shaped the R interface, it also defined how
we want to build interfaces to online databases. 

In its initial state we wanted an interface to interactively query databases
such as KEGG or MSigDB for up-to-date information about genes, gene sets or
biological pathways. This interface should be available within the data
exploration applications to provide valuable metadata, such as gene summaries,
for the researchers exploring results.  

% TODO: Describe the interfaces/API. 

\subsection*{Building applications} 
With Kvik there are multiple avenues developers can take to build data
exploration applications. Either bundle analysis and database lookup on a single
computer, or separate computational tasks to more powerful compute clusters to
improve performance. 
In this paper we discuss how to develop applications that follow a
microservices architecture where data analysis and storage is simply a service. 

In Kvik we use R packages as the fundamental building block for data exploration
applications. They provide an interface to data and analyses, and especially in
the field of systems biology, the R programming language provide the largest
collection of data analysis packages. % litt vagt kanskje? 
We discovered that the most sensible way to build applications on top of our
existing code base was to build a system that could interface with our analysis
code directly. In Kvik we built an HTTP interface on top of R that allows users
to call functions and get results using any programming language with an HTTP
library. This allows developers to build data exploration applications in the
programming language that is most suitable, or has the best support, for
presenting that specific data type. 

\subsection*{Statistical analyses}
\emph{Describe how we've designed the interface with R: Build an R-package and call
functions from it, we provide four different output formats to the user
(json, csv, pdf, png),  as well as four different http endpoints (call, get and
rpc).}

The R interface in Kvik follows many of the design patterns in OpenCPU. Both
systems interface with R packages using a hybrid state pattern over HTTP. Both
systems provide the same interface to execute analyses and retrieve results.
While OpenCPU is implemented on top of R and Apache, Kvik is implemented from
the ground up in Go. Because of the similarities in the interface to R in Kvik
we provide packages for interfacing with our own R server or OpenCPU R servers
through the \emph{gopencpu} package. 

The R server in Kvik builds on the standard \emph{http} library in Go. On start
it launches a user-defined number of R sessions that execute analyses on demand.
This allows for parallel execution of analyses. We provide a simple FIFO queue
for queuing of requests. The R server also provides the opportunity for users to
cache analysis results to speed up subsequent calls. 

The Kvik R server is suitable for applications where the analysis should be run
on a different server than the web-server hosting the application. If users want
to bundle both the application and R server on the same machine, the \emph{r}
package in Kvik provides this functionality. Although this is possible, we
believe that following a modular approach separating analysis and
application user-interface makes a cleaner and easier to maintain application. 

\subsection*{Databases}
Describe the interface to the databases and what we use it for. Could be
interesting to talk about provenance/caching.

\section*{Results and Discussion}
Describe the MIxT application. Also talk about how our R interface scales and
what makes it better than opencpu/renji.


\subsection*{Use Case}
We show the viability and need for Kvik by describing the MIxT application for
exploring and comparing transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples.
We describe its functionality, implementation 
% (uten fokus på Kvik)
and performance requirements.
%OG ANDRE VIKTIGE TING (SECURITY, ETC). 
Then we describe how MIxT
is designed to separate concerns and allow for a layered implementation. We use
this to motivate the need and opportunities to abstract away common
functionality of these type of applications.

% Det kan godt være at vi bør flytte denne et sted, men her beskriver vi hvordan 
% MIxT-appen fungerer. 
\subsection*{Matched Interaction Across Tissues (MIxT)}
We have built a system to identify genes and pathways in the primary tumor that
are tightly linked to genes and pathways in the patient systemic
response\cite{dumeaux2017}. MIxT blood-tumor is an open-source web application
for exploring the molecular processes expressed in each tissue. 

For the web application we defined six analysis tasks: 

\textbf{Explore co-expression relationships between genes}. Create an
interactive network visualization that visualizes each gene as a node and
significan co-expression relationship as an edge. 

\textbf{Explore co-expression gene sets in tumor and blood tissue}.
Visualize gene expression together with clinicopathological variables associated
with each module. Include results of gene set analyses that describe the
underlying biological functions of the modules. 

\textbf{Explore relationships between modules from each tissue.}
Visualize how modules from each tissue are related using two different
metrics, ranksum and gene overlap. Also enable subtype selection,
enabling users to investigate relationships within a particular subtype. 

\textbf{Explore relationships between clinical variables and modules.}
Visualize significant associations between module expression and
clinical variables.

\textbf{Explore association between user-submitted gene lists and computed
modules.} Allow users to upload own gene lists and have the application compute
modules which the gene list is enriched for. 

\textbf{Search for genes or gene lists of intrest.} Allow users to search
for specific genes or genelists of intrest and show what modules they are
associated with.

\label{fig_sim}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection*{Design and Implementation}
The MIxT application is designed as a multitier web application that consists of
a compute backend and a webserver frontend. From our initial analyses we built
an R package with functions to provide data and analysis to the different
analysis tasks. Using this design it is possible to either explore the data
through the web site or a local R session. 

To explore the co-expression relationship between genes we use an interactive
graph visualization build with Sigmajs\footnote{\url{sigmajs.org}}. We have
built visualization for both tissues, with graph sizes of 2705 nodes and 90 348
edges for the blood network, and 2066 nodes and 50 563 edges for the biopsy
network. The sigmajs visualization library has functionality for generating a
layout for large networks, but we generate this layout server-side to reduce the
computational load on the client. To generate this layout we use the GGally
package\footnote{\url{cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GGally}}. 

We have built modules for each tissue, and to explore gene sets associated with
genes in these modules, we provide module overview pages that show gene
expression visualized together with clinicopathological variables and gene set
analyses that describe the underlying functions of the module. 

We have used different metrics to link the modules from each tissue, ranksum and
gene overlap. To visualize the associations we use the
d3\footnote{\url{d3js.org}} library to build an interactive heatmap
visualization. 

To allow users to explore the relationship between clinical variables and the
computed modules, we built an interctive heatmap visualization that visualizes
the association between different metrics and each module.
