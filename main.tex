% TODO:
% - Draw up a sketch of what is MIxT and what is Kvik
% - What interfaces does Kvik provide?
% - Spark, look at their papers and the app / abstractions.
% - What are the ops done most frequent? Get data from KEGG/Msigdb etc?
% - Scrap hard line breaks for LA (soft lines instead)
% - add pdf to git.

In the past decade the generation of biological datasets has been unprecedented, and the famous "\$1000k genome, \$1M analysis"\cite{} has become more apparent. To decrease both time and cost of analysing biological data, there is now a growing number of analysis framework in various programming languages. \cite{}

In R, there are popular package repositories such as CRAN \url{cran.r-project.org} or Bioconductor \url{bioconductor.org} where developers can share software packages and keep them up-to-date. In these repositories researchers can find software for analysing high-throughput genomic data in one environment. Analysing includes both pre-processing, e.g. cleaning, removing outliers, and analysing it with know statistical methods.

Especially large datasets in biology require sophisticated methods for visualizing and communicating the data. In


% The big issue: There is no link between analysis and final presentation

\section*{Methods}
% Collection of packages in the Go programming language for building data
% exploration applications.  Interfaces with popular online databases such as
% MSigDB and KEGG.  Provides an interface to the R programming language.
% Typically used to build web apps, but commandline tools are also possible!




\section*{Results and Discussion}

% MIxT.
% Interactive web application for exploring WGCNA modules from blood and biopsy.
% Integrate results with known genesets and online databases.
% Docker containers for reproducibility and portability.
% Data analysis: R package  + Kvik = R in the browser.
% Visualization: D3, SigmaJS, R Plots
% How can we improve Kvik and its features: R user input sanitation, security,
