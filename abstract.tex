        \parttitle{Background} 
            In scientific fields such as systems biology there is a need for
            interactive data exploration tools to enable new insights in the
            fast growing datasets. 
            These tools need to combine advanced statistical analyses, known
            biology from up-to-date reference databases, and interactive visualizations.  
            To answer specific research questions tools must
            provide specialized user interfaces and visualizations. While these
            are application-specific, the underlying components of a
            data analysis tool can be shared and reused later. 
            Application developers can therefore compose applications of
            reusable services rather than implementing a single monolithic
            application. 
            
        \parttitle{Results} 
            We have designed an approach for developing data exploration
            applications in systems biology that builds on the microservice
            architecture. We use this approach to build applications that
            integrate advanced statistical software and up-to-date information
            from biological databases with modern data visualization libaries. 
            We demonstrate its viability through the  MIxT Blood-Tumor web application for exploring
            and comparing transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples.
            In addition we have used our microservices to build two other web-applications and
            several command-line tools. 
            % LAB: Blir litt gjentagende her.
            With a microservices approach building on software container
            technology we can re-use and share key components between
            application reducing development, deployment and maintenance time. 
            % LAB: noe om performance & noe om code quality?

        \parttitle{Conclusions}  
            Our approach and reference implementation Kvik is open-sourced at
            \url{github.com/fjukstad/kvik}. The web application for exploring
            transcriptional profiles, MIxT, is available at
            \url{mixt-blood-tumor.bci.mcgill.ca} and its source code at 
            \url{github.com/fjukstad/mixt}.
