We have designed an approach for building data exploration applications in
systems biology that builds on a microservice architecture. Using this approach
we have built a web application that leverages this architecture to integrate
statistical analyses, interactive visualizations, and data from biological
databases. While we have used our approach to build an application in systems
biology, we believe that the microservice architecture can be used to build data
exploration systems in other disciplines as well.
