        \parttitle{Background} 
            In scientific fields such as systems biology there is a need for
            data exploration tools that can enable new insights. 
            Such tools need to integrate advanced statistical analyses with
            known biology from up-to-date databases to leverage the wealth of
            existing knowledge.
            However there are few systems that enable the development of new
            tools that integrate these. 
            
            
        \parttitle{Results} 
            We have designed an approach for developing data exploration
            applications in systems biology, and demonstrated its viability
            through a web application for exploring and comparing
            transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples. Our approach
            makes it possible to explore data from advanced statistical
            software packages in any modern programming language, together with 
            up-to-date online databases to create applications that integrates
            data with known biology. 
            

        \parttitle{Conclusions}  
            Our approach and reference implementation Kvik, enables easy
            development of data exploration tools that provide reproducible
            analyses using efficient processing. 
            Kvik is open-sourced at \url{github.com/fjukstad/kvik} and the web
            application for exploring transcriptional profiles, MIxT, is 
            availible at \url{github.com/fjukstad/mixt}.
