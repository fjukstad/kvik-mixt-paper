        \parttitle{Background} 
            In scientific fields such as systems biology there is a need for
            data exploration tools that can enable discovery of new insights. 
            Such tools need to integrate advanced statistical analyses with
            known biology from up-to-date databases to leverage the wealth of
            existing knowledge in data exploration.
            However there are few systems that enable the development of new
            tools that combine these. 
            
            
        \parttitle{Results} 
            We have designed an approach for developing data exploration
            applications in systems biology, and demonstrated its viability
            through a web application for exploring and comparing
            transcriptional profiles from blood and tumor samples. We show that
            it is possible to leverage advanced statistical software packages
            together with up-to-date online databases to create applications
            that integrates data with known biology. 
            

        \parttitle{Conclusions}  
            Our approach and reference implementation Kvik, enables easy
            development of data exploration tools that provide reproducible
            analyses using efficient processing. 
            Kvik is open-sourced at \url{github.com/fjukstad/kvik} and the web
            application for exploring transcriptional profiles, MIxT, is 
            availible at \url{github.com/fjukstad/mixt}.
