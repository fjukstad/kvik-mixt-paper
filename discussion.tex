The compute service in Kvik follows many of the design patterns in
OpenCPU. Both systems interface with R packages using a hybrid state pattern
over HTTP. Both systems provide the same interface to execute analyses and
retrieve results.  While OpenCPU is implemented on top of R and Apache, Kvik is
implemented from the ground up in Go. Because of the similarities in the
interface to R in Kvik we provide packages for interfacing with our own R server
or OpenCPU R servers through the
\emph{gopencpu} package.\footnote{\url{github.com/fjukstad/kvik/tree/master/gopencpu}} 


\subsection*{WIP: Future work} 
While we have buit 

We have built a database service that provides a sufficient interface for the
MIxT web application. While we have developed the software packages for
interfacing with more databases, these haven't been included in the database
service yet. 

One large concern that we haven't addressed in this paper is security. In
particular one security concern that we plan to address in Kvik is the
restrictions on

database, and security concerns regarding remote code execution within the
compute service.
